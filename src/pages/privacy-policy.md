Examples include payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third parties to use tracking technology on the Services, which will enable them to collect data about how you interact with the Services over time.

***In Short:***  *We are not responsible for the safety of any information you share with third-party providers who advertise, but are not affiliated with, our websites.*

The Services may contain advertisements from third parties affiliated with us, which may link to other websites, online services, or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of the data you provide to any third parties.

This privacy policy does not cover any data collected by third parties. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy unless a more extended retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this Policy will need us to keep your personal information for longer than two years.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## **7)** **HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?**

***In Short:***  *We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.*

We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure.

You should only access the services within a secure environment.

## **8)** **DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?**

## **9)** **WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?**

***In Short:***  *You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.*

***Cookies and similar technologies:*** Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and reject cookies.

## **10)** **CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES**

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected.

No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.

## **11)** **DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?**

***In Short:***  *Yes, if you are a California resident, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.*

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal data (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Services, you have the right to request the removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California.

***In Short:***  *Yes, we will update this Policy as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.*

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date, and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible.
