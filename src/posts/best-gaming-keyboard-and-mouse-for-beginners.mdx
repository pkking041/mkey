  ### Buying Guide 


  The most important factors that you should always look at before buying a keyboard and mouse combo at the start of your gaming journey include its design, features, comfort and price (obviously). As you are just starting, it is better to choose a reasonably priced keyboard rather than a fancy featured keyboard that only empties your pockets. 


  I would also not recommend an extremely low priced keyboard and mouse combo because it's a fact that the less the price, the less quality you get. However, some brands provide impressive quality within the minimum cost. Try your luck! 


  Moreover, hover the place or your desk and identify the size a keyboard should have to fit easily in your playing area. For keyboard size, if you are just starting a gaming journey, then a market sized keyboard will be fine. However, if you have a ton of tasks, then having a little larger keyboard with a numeric pad is worthwhile. 


  Just try to cut the extra dollars for features you really don't need. 


  Secondly, look for the switches you like considering Cherry MX; a better standard comes in different types: red for quite linear, brown for quite tactile and blue for noisy tactile functions. Other manufacturers produce similar types with additional color coding. 


  Before a few months back, RGB backlighting was a factor in increasing the overall price of keyboards. But, now, most brands are offering RGB backlit with the same reasonable price tag. So, if you like giving your desk a more gaming zone look, buying a keyboard with RGB backlights is for sure worth it.
