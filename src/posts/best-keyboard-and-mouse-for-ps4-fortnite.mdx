  ### Buying considerations 


  You might be very excited to play Fortnite, but before buying a keyboard with other accessories, let me tell you some most common and necessary features to help you have a better Fortnite gaming experience.


  Starting from the visual context, in Fortnite, you don’t just have to look at what is happening in the game; rather, you are also concerned with the audio and sound that help you prepared to protect yourself from the enemy’s sniper and vice versa. 


  Therefore, for this purpose, you would need a full-featured headset. Luckily, from the above mentioned, some keyboards also come with a headset. However, if you find the headset an unnecessary one, you should only switch to a less priced keyboard or mouse for PS4 Fortnite. 


  Furthermore, let’s start with keyboard considerations; 


  Look for switches present under each key. Make sure the type of keyboard switches, either mechanical or membrane. Mechanical switches produce click sounds, tactile responses, and take less travel time. However, membrane keyboards produce fewer sounds and more spongy presses. 

  Size formation including, full size, TKL, and 60% or 40% keyboards; you should look for a full-size keyboard as it will contain more keys and function options. TKL sized keyboards are also considered fair enough for gaming. However, 60% and 40% of sized keyboards contain fewer keys and reduced functions. 

  Now, let’s see mouse considerations. 


  The sensor or sensitivity of the mouse is the foremost factor to look for before buying one. The sensor tracks the accurate positions and movements of the mouse during your play. However, the dpi (dot per inch) shows the sensitivity level of the mouse. So, the more dpi the more mouse sensitivity. 

  Another factor to look at is the mouse’s size, shape, and length. The more compact, lighter, and side curves shaped mouse, the better gaming will be. In other words, you should look at either the mouse you are going to buy comfortable and have a good grip on your hand or not. 


  ### **Summary** 


  Wrapping the discussion on the best keyboard and mouse for ps4 Fortnite, you might see all the keyboards are well integrated with the advancements specially designed for gamers to make themselves a pro in the gaming world. 


  Moreover, if you find any trouble selecting a keyboard and a mouse for Fortnite, you should break your requirements and be more specific. You can also take help by reading precise considerations and FAQs to help you get a better idea.
